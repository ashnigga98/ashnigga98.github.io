<b>Some more thingzz about myself</b>
<br>
I am referred to as the Dark Lord by my most loyal underlings and the Mad Titan by the galactic community.
I command two massive armies, known as the Chitauri and the Outriders, and a small group of followers known as the Black Order. My own main objective was to bring stability from the universe, as I believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire resources and condemn it. 
I spent many years hunting down these stones and my desire to achieve his ultimate goal is what led me to forge new alliances with those incompetent fools Loki and Ronan the Accuser. 
Both of the new alliances had cost me a lot, including my precious Tesseract and my lil girls, Gamora and Nebula, and inadvertently resulted in the formation of these so called thugs Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Fed up with all the failures of my subordinates, I opted to seek out the location of the Infinity Stones myself.
<br>
In my journey, me and my Black Order homies invaded Xandar, Earth, and Knowhere and even murdered that sneaky fool Loki, along with half of the surviving Asgardians, and I didn't even spare my sweet Gamora coz Stonez is bae. 
There were many small street gangs coming up against me, they called themselves the Avengers, Masters of the Mystic Arts, Guardians of the Galaxy, and a low class underdeveloped nation called Wakanda. 
Despite facing off against a man with a toy spear and poor aim that was Thor, I ultimately triumphed over all these n00bs once I completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using this to finally complete my goal and destroy half of the life within the universe at the snap of his fingers.
<br>
*snap*

That is why the other half of this page is missing. Because half of my page admins and html coders got turned to dust.

Saying this to that Stark dude that he will be remembered.. He was a slight challenge. Not at all hard for a stud like Thanos tho babez!

Test run of the gauntlet. Safe to say it was very satisfying.

Gamora has got a nice taste in boys. I should have sent the marriage invitation soon. Too bad there was that soul stone to take care of.
